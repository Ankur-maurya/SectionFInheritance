# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

## Types of Inheritance

### Simple Inheritance.  
- It typically includes a single parent class (superclass)
and a single child class (subclass).
- But, it can have more that one child classes.
- The emphasis is on the number of parent classes, i.e there should be only one parent class.

### Multi-level Inheritance.
- It typically includes a set of  
 a grand parent class (superclass of the superclass)  
 a parent class (the superclass)  
 a child class (the subclass)

### Multiple Inheritance.
- It is not allowed in Java.
We inherit properties from more than one parent class.

### Hybrid Inheritance.
Requires an Abstract Class or an Interface.
 
## Types of Polymorphism

### Method Overloading
- Changing the behaviour of methods on the basis of inputs.
- It can be done either via changing the number of parameters of a method or changing the type of the parameters.

### Method Overriding
- Changing the behaviour of a method on the basis of the objects.
- The signature of the method that you want to override, should be exactly same!

## Use of Visibility Modifiers with Classes & Methods while using Inheritance
1. public : class/method can be accessed anywhere in the project! 
2. private : 
3. protected
4. <default>.
